# Mock CAS Server

This is a CAS server implementation targeted as a simple mock, but still functional. The CAS servers follows the specification of https://apereo.github.io/cas/4.2.x/protocol/CAS-Protocol.html. The used CAS protocol version is 2.0.

Proxy handling is not implemented, only the SSO login process (routes `/login` and `/serviceValidate` in CAS 2.0).

Features:

* simulate successful login, returning a service ticket
* validate service ticket

It can be used during development for your CAS aware application if you need a simple mock CAS service.

## Login

The `/login` path will simulate the results of a successful login session: a redirect to the given service will be issued. A newly generated service ticket will be appended in the target URL (service URL) as a query parameter.

## Ticket validation

Service tickets generated by a `/login` are memorized over a expiry period of 5 minutes. When a ticket is validated via `/serviceValidate`, a valid service ticket must be presented. In other words, a ticket which as not been used so far for any operation and which is less than 5 minutes old.
