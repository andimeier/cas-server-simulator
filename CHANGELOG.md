## Change Log

### v1.0.0 (2017-05-15)
- Single Logout (SLO) works. The registered service will be notified via POST request

### v1.0.0 (2017-05-02)
- Login works
- A complete SSO cycle can be set up with this version
- Each time the CAS server simulator is "requested", the user has to login via WWW form, so the CAS server simulator does keep track of "ticket granting tickets" (TGT) nor keep an own user session
